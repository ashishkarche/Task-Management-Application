# Task Management Backend

This is the backend for a task management application built with Express.js, connected to a MySQL database. It provides endpoints for creating, updating, deleting, and fetching tasks with features like status updates and deadline tracking.

## Features

- **Fetch all tasks**: Get all tasks, categorized by their status (`To Do`, `In Progress`, `Completed`, `Expired`).
- **Create a new task**: Add new tasks with a title, description, status, and deadline.
- **Update task status**: Update the status of an existing task (e.g., mark it as `In Progress` or `Completed`).
- **Delete a task**: Remove a task from the database.
- **Automatic status update**: Tasks are automatically marked as `Expired` if their deadline has passed and their status is not `Completed`.

## Technologies

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **MySQL**: Relational database to store tasks.
- **CORS**: Middleware to allow cross-origin requests.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
